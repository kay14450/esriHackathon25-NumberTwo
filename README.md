## For Developers

### Project Setup

In order to contribute to this project, you should start by cloning the repo onto your local machine.

Then, you must install node.js in order to obtain all the necessary dependencies.

Open the project in your IDE of choice, then in a terminal cd into the project's directory.

Then run `cd number-two` and `npm i`, which will install the necessary dependencies. (NOTE: if you receive a permission error, you should run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
` in a separate Powershell terminal

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, run `npm run dev`. This will start an instance of the web app in on localhost, which you can now prototype on!

### React Dev Tips
