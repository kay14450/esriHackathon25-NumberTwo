# ESRI Hackathon25 NumberTwo - Gotta Go

## About

Gotta Go is a standalone React web application that utilizes ArcGIS SDK technology to provide users with a seamless way to find convenient bathrooms on the go.

## For Developers

In order to contribute to this project, you should start by cloning the repo onto your local machine.

Then, you must install node.js in order to obtain all the necessary dependencies.

Open the project in your IDE of choice, then in a terminal cd into the project's directory.

Then run `cd number-two` and `npm i`, which will install the necessary dependencies. (NOTE: if you receive a permission error, you should run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
` in a separate Powershell terminal

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, run `npm run dev`. This will start an instance of the web app in on localhost, which you can now prototype on!
